<p>New checks were introduced by SAP Note <a href=\"https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2006072/E\"
        target=\"_blank\">2006072</a>&nbsp;(or corresponding Support package of EA-PS). Because of this, it is necessary
    to analyze the FM update profile details in combination with your settings for Closing Operations (CCF) in Funds
    Management.</p>\n<p>For this procedure, you can start report <strong>RFFMMONI</strong> from transaction code SE38 to
    verify which kind of profile are you using:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Period-Based Encumbrance Tracking
        (<strong>PBET</strong>). &nbsp;</li>\n<li>Annual/Fiscal Year-Based Encumbrance Tracking
        (<strong>ABET</strong>/<strong>YBET</strong>).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Below, you can find an output example of report RFFMMONI:</p>\n<p><img

    your settings for Commitment Carryforward (CCF)&nbsp;in the IMG&nbsp;activities for Closing operations, to determine
    if Carryforward (CCF)&nbsp;of Value type 54 is allowed: <br />Public Sector Management -&gt; Funds Management
    Government -&gt; Closing Operations<br />Enter Default Settings<br />and<br />Commitment Closing Operations -&gt;
    Enter Settings for Commitment Carryforward Payment Budget<br /><br /></p>\n<p>By knowing those settings, combined
    with your FM update profile information, you can identify one of the 4 possible solutions.</p>
